Razorpay Checkout Debug & Fix Checklist (Chrome Issues)

1. Script Loading
- [ ] Ensure checkout.js is always loaded from https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js
- [ ] Use cache-busting query param (e.g., ?v=...)
- [ ] Verify in Chrome DevTools (Network tab) that the script loads with 200 status

2. Caching & Service Worker
- [ ] Check if server/CDN is caching checkout.js
  - In DevTools → Network → Response Headers → look for Cache-Control, Expires
  - Should be: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
- [ ] Check if a Service Worker is active on your site
  - DevTools → Application → Service Workers
  - Ensure it does not cache razorpay.com scripts

3. CDN / Proxy Rules
- [ ] If using Cloudflare/NGINX/CDN:
  - Confirm query string (?v=...) is respected (treated as separate resource)
  - Add rule: Bypass cache for checkout.razorpay.com

4. Cookies & SameSite
- [ ] Ensure your site is fully on HTTPS
- [ ] Check Razorpay cookies in DevTools → Application → Cookies
  - Must include SameSite=None; Secure
- [ ] Confirm browser settings do not block third-party cookies

5. Browser / Extension Interference
- [ ] Test with AdBlock, uBlock, Privacy Badger disabled
- [ ] Incognito works → indicates extension or cached script issue

6. Fallback Loader
- [ ] Add fallback script loader to retry if checkout.js fails to load

7. Console & Network Errors
- [ ] Open DevTools → Console → check for errors (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT, Mixed Content, CORS, cookie blocked)
- [ ] Network tab → confirm checkout.js request status and failure reason

Action Plan
1. Extract Console + Network logs in Chrome DevTools to identify exact issue
2. Adjust Service Worker rules to bypass caching for Razorpay scripts
3. Set server/CDN headers: Cache-Control: no-store for checkout.js
4. Implement fallback script loader to retry on failure
5. Verify third-party cookie settings allow Razorpay’s checkout flow
